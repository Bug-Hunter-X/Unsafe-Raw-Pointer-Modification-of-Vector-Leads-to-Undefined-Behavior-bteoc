This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: unsafe manipulation of a vector using raw pointers. The `bug.rs` file contains code that directly modifies the vector's memory through a raw pointer. This can cause unexpected behavior because it violates Rust's memory safety guarantees.  The `bugSolution.rs` file shows a safer and more idiomatic Rust way to modify the vector contents.
